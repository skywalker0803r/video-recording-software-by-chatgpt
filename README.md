Video Recording Software by ChatGPT
This is a simple Python-based screen recording software that captures and saves a video of your screen, along with an audio recording. The software uses OpenCV and sounddevice libraries to capture the screen and record audio respectively. The output video file is saved in the AVI format, while the audio is saved as a WAV file.

Prerequisites
To use this software, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following Python packages:

opencv-python
numpy
sounddevice
scipy
You can install these packages using pip, a package installer for Python. Open a command prompt or terminal and type the following command:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy sounddevice scipy
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the repository's directory in a command prompt or terminal.

Run the following command to start the recording:

Copy code
python video_recorder.py
While the recording is in progress, you can press the 'q' key to stop the recording.

After the recording is stopped, the video and audio files will be saved in the current directory.

Configuration
You can adjust the recording settings by modifying the variables at the beginning of the video_recorder.py file. For example, you can change the recording duration by modifying the seconds variable, or change the output video file format by modifying the fourcc variable.
